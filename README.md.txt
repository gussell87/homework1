Homework #1
HTML: Two of the three headers along the top-right of the page link to that section, but the first one - Search Engine Optimization doesn't. Looking at the code, it doesn't have Div ID. This was added and page now moves to that section when clicked.
HTML: Title updated to include business name & primary services.
HTML: The code needs divs to be replaced by semantic elements. They were renamed as header, nav, figure, section (& articles within), aside and footer. This gives other coders a better idea of where each will sit.
CSS: Each of the main articles has the same style as each other. Therefore, I have grouped them under the article class and remove the duplication on the CSS page that made the page messy.
CSS: Similarly, each benefit on the right was styled the same. They were grouped under aside.
CSS: Styling tags moved & grouped by element, in the order by which they appear on the page.
CSS: Used /**/ to identify each element’s styling group.
HTML: Used <!----> to identify each element.
HTML: Added alt: “” to each image. title: “” was added to figure/hero image as its attributes were in CSS file.
HTML: Checked links after changing semantic labels. Had to re-ad id tags to get them working again.
